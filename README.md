# The-Game
Magic: The Creater's Seat

So this is a Trading Card Game eat your heart 
out; where rather than playing with a 
preconceived deck and rules: you use a 
basic 52 card playing deck and a makeshift 
rule guide that helps you craft a fun game.

For the deck simply: the spades attack, 
diamonds give reasourses(ie land/energy), 
clubs stun, & hearts heal.

The rules are a simplified adaptation of the 
Mayan "Tzolkin," 260(13x20) day calendar.  
The Spades represent tue Red color signs, 
Diamonds White, Clubs Blue, & Hearts Red.

I always wanted a Tzolkin game, now I realized 
you can make up rules if you think of your 
attacker as(inwardly/outwardly) Love/Nurter, 
Ignition/Start, Penans/Command, Tribute/Work, 
& Senc/Connect.  13x4x5 or 13x20

The idea is that Love helps you think of a 
worthy attack: makes your mind adjust to HP, 
attack damage, & the like...whatever you can 
think up.

I'll be uploading Card Game Simulater files, 
and more in depth rulings shortly.
